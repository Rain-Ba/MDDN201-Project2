                <h1>Various Antennas</h1> 
                <P>Traces of the antenna can be seen all over Wellington city, and I went around several blocks to find some unique buildings and residential areas. The average wire is so intricate that it's hard to tell what's connected to the network.</P>

				<h3>Antennas</h3>
				<P>Two antennas found together but in different shapes in a residential area are also often camouflages, although cell towers camouflages elsewhere (trees, church crosses, cactus) are relatively simple.</P>

				<h3>Cell Towers</h3>
				<P>Most of us are now using wireless networks or 3G/4G networks, which are connected to the network through cell towers. Generally, they're hard to see from the street - they're mostly on top of buildings. This is a signal tower I found on a building.</P>
